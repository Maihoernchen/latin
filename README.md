# Latin

To execute the learning-programm execute the main.py-file with python3.

* After starting the programm a pygame-window will appear. The caption is the question-type(Deklination,Conjugation,Vocabulary,Grammar).
* The whole Programm is in german, I will fix this in later versions.
* The big word or sentence is either a conjugated/deklinated word, a vocab-word, or a sentence/word with a certain grammatical rule.
* To input your answer, press the key you belive to be the right answer (1,2,3 or 4).
* Once you put in your answer, the window will close.
* After 2 seconds it will appear again, if you guessed right another question will appear, if you guessed wrong, the program will ask you the same question again.
* This will happen 5 times. After you guessed right 5 times the program will rest for 10 minutes and the ask 5 questions again.
* If you guess wrong, it will not count.
